    "### Project Plan\n",
    "On January 4, 1936, Billboard magazine published its first list of the most popular songs based on their sales, radio airplay, digital downloading and online streaming, such as YouTube.  Each week since then, Billboard magazine has been charting the popularity of the top 100 songs in the U.S.. Similarly, Spotify, one of the leading music streaming apps of today, also compiles a yearly list of top songs based on the number of times the song was streamed by the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the pressure to make it into the top hits, record companies try to create music that might appeal to a large audience; however, it is difficult to understand what certain aspects of a song makes it a top hit. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I will be providing a data science analysis on data sets of top songs collected by Billboard and Spotify from various years to find different correlates of successful songs in order to determine what key qualities a song needs to become a hit.  "

    "I found the data that I needed was already provided in a dataset on Kaggle as \"Top Spotify songs from 2010-2019 - BY YEAR\" by Leonardo Henrique. I checked the data and found that it was already tidy and no validation errors. The dataset was extracted from Spotify and Billboard and organized by Spotify Organize Your Music: http://organizeyourmusic.playlistmachinery.com/. The data set included my target variable, the popularity score of each song, and explanatory variables, audio features, which include beats per minute (BPM), danceability, loudness, energy, valence, and duration. It also included general characteristics, such as the genre, the title, the artists, and the year the song was released. "
